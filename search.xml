    <title>Windows 11 use half a year experience &amp; worth teasing</title>
    <url>/2022/05/02/Win11/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since Microsoft released Windows 11, I’ve been upgrading my 20-year-old PC. After six months with Windows 11, I feel I’m qualified to talk about my experience.<br>First of all, when upgrading, my computer did not have TPM 2.0. When the preview came out, I installed various preview virtual machines until the official release.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/2022/05/02/Win11/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a><br>I stayed up late to watch several events and learned a lot about Windows 11.</p>
<h1 id="New-features-amp-new-look-amp-must-be-teased"><a href="#New-features-amp-new-look-amp-must-be-teased" class="headerlink" title="New features &amp; new look &amp; must be teased"></a>New features &amp; new look &amp; must be teased</h1><p>This time Windows 11 moved the taskbar icon to the center, or center. Center probably does not have what substantive use to me, but each have each view and be fond of, anyway I think center only use is for beautiful. But… For those of you who don’t know about macOS, the Windows 11 taskbar does pay homage to the Dock in a sense, and it’s mostly cosmetic. The downside of the Windows 11 taskbar is that it’s not as bottomless as the Dock. Windows 11’s taskbar is always limited, and unlike the Dock, it shrinks itself to make more space. When I used macOS primarily, I had a habit of putting all the apps I had installed on the Dock. Windows 11 didn’t allow me to do that, so I decided to uncenter the taskbar so I could cram more.</p>

    <title>Mi Band 6, the peak of smart band world? Daily use experience of Xiaomi Wristband</title>
    <url>/2022/04/24/%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%B3%E6%89%8B%E7%8E%AF6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mi Band 6 is a new generation of mi band released in March last year. Compared with previous generations of Mi band, you can find it has a huge improvement in all aspects, and even it is not praised as the peak of smart band industry. Mi Band 6, what on earth is worth my recommendation?</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/https://muyanglarry.github.io/2022/04/24/%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%B3%E6%89%8B%E7%8E%AF6/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a></p>
<p>First of all, compared with the previous generation, the biggest improvement of this generation is the appearance. In terms of appearance, mi Band 6 is the first to use an AMOLED runway display, which increases the screen area by 50% compared to mi Band 5. The information displayed on the screen can be swiped to view, more smoothly, is really deep in my heart. Don’t use a brighter dial, wouldn’t it be a waste of such a smooth runway screen? This time, Millet provided more than 130 dial, colorful dial, really too in line with my colorful personality. The Mi Band 6 has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, which makes me never take it off when I shower or sleep. This time, magnetic charge is also used, and there is a charging animation for the runway full screen.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a sports bracelet, Mi Band 6 also has a lot of motivation for people like me who do not like sports. First, a reminder about sitting. I sometimes cut a video and sit for seven or eight hours, which is very unfriendly to my back. At this point, the bracelet will remind me, it’s time to get up and exercise. The Mi Band 6 supports 30 sports modes this time, less than the watch, but enough for me. Most of the use of a few, running, walking, cycling and so on. Why does it motivate me? Because is an individual can feel so rich motion function, need not come to motion is not wasted?</p>
<p>In addition, mi bracelet 6 for my student party or very helpful. It has an alarm clock to prevent me from being late for school. It has a tomato clock, which can improve my study efficiency. It has a countdown that controls when I do my homework. It also has breathing training and pressure detection, which enables me to know my pressure condition and relieve it when the study pressure is very heavy. When the Mi Band 6 connects to the phone, it can display notifications on the phone without missing any of your friends. Occasionally, a simple notification view is possible. Mi Band 6 also has a very YYDS function, which is remote photo control. You can connect on your phone, and then you can. Use a wristband to control taking photos. The use scenario is that when taking a group photo, there is no one to take the photo, and everyone can be in the picture.</p>
<p>The Mi Band 6 is an epic upgrade over its predecessor. Feature rich and complete, but also super cost-effective, for the student party is very friendly. It supports non-Xiaomi phone users, such as iOS users. I believe the future of Mi bracelet will be better.</p>

    <url>/2022/04/24/%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%B36/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Mi 6, has been on sale for a year. In the years since its release, there has been a saying in mobile phone circles: buy new, don’t buy old, unless mi 6. Mi 6, the digital flagship released by Xiaomi Company in 2017, has become a king of the generation with the advantages that are difficult to be achieved by the current digital flagship, as well as the excellent performance that now seems to be very outstanding</p>

What’s the magic of a phone like this?<br>The Mi 6, powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, was a king at the time. With an eight-core processor and a 10nm process, performance-wise, it’s a no-brainer. Such a high performance chip, but low power consumption, no heat, at that time can be said to be the flagship of the flagship processing platform. Use it to run some games, no problem, no stress. The rest of the mainstream software is very smooth to use, nothing to say. With performance out of the way, let’s talk about how it looks and feels.</p>

    <title>Salvage MIUI&#39;s reputation? MIUI 13 development version daily use experience for a week</title>
    <url>/2022/04/24/MIUI%2013/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I upgraded MIUI 13 on my Xiaomi phone and used it and played with it for a week.<br>At the end of 2021, Xiaomi held a new product release conference, MIUI 13, which was expected to be released. With the arrival of MIUI 12, we looked at the various new functions at the conference. Did MIUI 13 really restore MIUI’s reputation?</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/2022/04/24/MIUI%2013/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a><br>First of all, the big improvement is fluency. There was no pressure to use it on my mid-range machine, either to exit animations, or to break animations or small pieces of animation, at least on my mid-range machine there were no frames dropped or stuck. Then there’s the new feature I’m most looking forward to: widgets. To add widgets, simply hold down on a blank area of the desktop, click Add Widget, select a widget you like, and drag it onto the desktop. In the appearance, it adds some personalized flavor, practical, convenient to check some important information at any time, such as time, date, and weather. And negative one screen also uses small pieces to arrange information. In addition, I found a very interesting place, is the memory free widget. One of my favorite updates is the “no word” mode, which makes the text under the ICONS disappear, making the desktop much cleaner, and adding a row of ICONS to display. Also added personalized flavor is, the new custom xiaoai function. You can customize the sex of xiao Ai and what to wear. MIUI 13 also features new fonts that are more nuanced and, importantly, free to use commercially.<br>What’s left is a few functional updates, starting with the features recommended in MIUI 13’s welcome screen, the global sidebar, and the front-facing camera assistant. Let’s start with the Global sidebar. If you open it in features, you’ll see a little white bar on the side of the screen. If you swipe inward, you’ll see a menu, and you can choose any app you want, and then you’ll open a little window. In fact, I think the MIUI widget has always been a good feature for opening other apps, such as replying to messages, without breaking the current one. There’s also the front-facing camera Assistant, which can also be turned on in features and can glow around the screen during a video call, supplementing the front-facing camera. There are also some more important features, which are about privacy. The first one is face verification protection, which is actually very important to prevent third-party apps from capturing the rest of your upper body during verification. The second is privacy watermark, when uploading ID photos, to prevent stolen use, even commercial. The third is fraud protection, can effectively prevent fraud phone calls, SMS fraud. Personally, I think it’s very useful. Another privacy-related feature is the clean mode, which will limit apps that have not been approved by Xiaomi, mainly by downloading self-installed packages, to improve system security. OK, finally, MIUI 13 has a lot of new features this time around. It is said that everything is based on MIUI. I personally am very optimistic about the future of MIUI and believe that Xiaomi can do MIUI better!</p>

    <title>Which of the major search engines is better? Market mainstream search engine use experience horizontal comment</title>
    <url>/2022/04/24/%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95%E6%93%8E/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Search engines are probably the most widely used software for all kinds of people. And the search engine is also the starting point for most people to surf the Internet, the entrance to all kinds of websites. There are many entrances like this. So, what kind of search engine experience is better?</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/https://muyanglarry.github.io/2022/04/24/%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95%E6%93%8E/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a></p>
<p>In this way, I did a survey and asked many friends around me, as well as my fans. Most of them used Baidu to search, while a small part used Google to search, and basically had no other answers.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a lot of search engines on the market now, I found the current mainstream search engines to conduct reviews, respectively Bing, Baidu, 360, Sogou and so on. We measure a search engine in terms of relevance, feature integrity, and AD volume, and use a few keywords for examples. All tests did not open the AD blocking plug-in, this video is not exactly food, please rest assured to eat.</p>
<p>Google search engine should be familiar to everyone, because it is the global search engine market in the market share of the highest, a large user group, high quality content, basically achieved no advertising, but unfortunately lost the Chinese market, most users can not use it. So we’re not going to review it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Baidu. As the world’s largest Chinese search engine, Baidu search ranks second only to Google in global search engine market share. The majority of Baidu search users are Chinese, most of them prefer Baidu and probably know that baidu is the only search engine on earth. But baidu’s search results are not good. Let’s look at an example. It is not difficult to find that the first few baidu search results are advertising, the real results in about ten lines later. Let’s try it again just to make sure it’s reasonable. In fact, Baidu will search content according to your domain, to give you the right advertising, really disgusting! Baidu has web pages, information, video, library, pictures and other search methods, is not small. Finally, to summarize: 1. More ads; 2. Low relevance; 3. It is recommended.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bing. Bing, now owned by Microsoft, ranks third in global search engine market share behind Baidu inc. Bing is now my main search engine, so far the experience is good, there is nothing to joke about. Of course, it is not comparable to Google search, but in the domestic mainstream search engine, its experience is like the camel among the sheep. Let’s look at an example. We can see that bing search results always have the most relevant results at the top, with negligible advertising. We tested other search terms and the results were the same. Bing’s search methods include web pages, images, videos, academics and dictionaries. Another feature that I think is very powerful is access to national and global search results. Conclusion: 1. No advertising 2. High relevance 3. Recommended.</p>
<p>Third, 360 search. 360search’s market share is less than 4 percent domestically and less than 0.1 percent abroad. Most of its users were forced to bundle up after installing 360familybucket, tampering with the browser home page. In 360’s search results, it can be found that the results are basically advertising, and the advertising marks are not obvious, which is very unfriendly to the elderly. The real results are hidden, undifferentiated from advertising, and have no official logo. Its search function is fairly complete, comparable to Baidu, but not as comprehensive as Baidu’s information. Use experience, disgusting! Conclusion: 1. Excessive advertising; 2. Low relevancy; 3. Not recommended.</p>
<p>Four, sogou search. Sogou has a domestic market share of about 12 percent, ranking second only to Baidu. Sogou search even before the fire over Baidu, and sogou browser’s own search engine is sogou search. But its search results aren’t great either. On the first page are either ads or highly irrelevant results, while the real results are on the last line. In a word, in a word, gross! Disgusting! The function that sogou searches also is equal with Baidu, do not have Baidu likewise comprehensive, but a few better than 360. Overall use: 1. More advertisements; 2. Low relevancy; 3. It is recommended.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend Google and Bing. I don’t like the others very much. It depends on personal preference.</p>

    <title>What is a chip? What is a lithography machine? How does China transform from a chip power to a chip power?</title>
    <url>/2022/04/24/%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When people use their mobile phones to surf Microblogs, Douyin, or play large games and follow popular TV series on the computer, they all sigh at the magic of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing, and feel proud of being in such an era of rapid development of science and technology. But many people may not know just how big a role chips play.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/2022/04/24/%E5%B0%8F%E7%B1%B3%E6%89%8B%E7%8E%AF6/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a></p>
<p>Chips are everywhere in our daily life. Chips are not only installed in computers, but also in our mobile phones, TV sets, air conditioners, water heaters and even remote controls.</p>
<p>The US had banned ZTE from buying or selling any products, software or technology subject to US export control regulations for seven years.</p>
<p>The move has pushed ZTE to the edge of a cliff. Zte’s core components such as mobile phone chips, baseband chips, memory chips and optical components are all from us tech giants such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, Intel and Xinfei Com. It is difficult to find a substitute with comparable performance in the short term, or even impossible to replace at all. Zte is one of The largest telecom equipment companies in China, but it will take a long time to replace its reliance on U.S. chip technology. Zte incident reflects the serious “lack of core” problem in the domestic communication industry.</p>
<p>China’s chip market demand accounts for more than 50% of the world, some chips account for 70%~80%, and 90% rely on imports, domestic chips can only supply about 8%. Obviously, the demand for chips in China is very large</p>
<p>In fact, the move, more than ZTE. Take Huawei for example. Huawei’s P50, which was just released last year, is equipped with its own Kirin chip only Pro series. As for the rest, In order to retain the Chinese market, Qualcomm allowed huawei to export chips, but only 4G chips. So, huawei’s new phone in addition to its own chips, almost said goodbye to 5G.</p>
<p>Chips, are they really that hard to make? A chip, also known as a microcircuit, is a piece of silicon containing integrated circuits. It is very small and is an important part of a computer or other electronic equipment, which is also known as the central processing unit, CPU. When it comes to core making, there’s a term that’s bound to come up: lithography. Photolithography, as the name implies, the so-called photolithography machine, with light as the media, depicting micro nano in the square inch, to achieve a variety of micron or even nano level of graphic processing. At present, the most advanced lithography machine can process the smallest line is 13 nanometers. Our human hair is between 50 and 70 microns in diameter, so photolithography can carve lines that are only 1&#x2F;5,000 of the diameter of a human hair. Isn’t that awesome?</p>
<p>China, a great country, can’t even make a lithography machine? Why will domestic chip technology be “stuck”? The ZTE incident has brought to light China’s difficulties with communications technology. Integrated circuit practitioners know that China’s lack of indigenous innovation in the high-end chip industry is a time bomb for the industry. There are many domestic home appliance manufacturers, the demand for chips is very large, although the domestic research chips can be supplied, but most power plants will choose higher high-end chips abroad. So we have to admit that China’s chip technology is not very mature. Experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have also said that China’s current chip technology, compared with the world’s giants, there are still many shortcomings, if China is still so dependent on imports, it means that China’s artificial intelligence technology, also under the control of others.</p>
<p>How to break through the industry bottleneck, from a chip power to a chip power, has always been a thorny problem for the Chinese government and industry. Some Chinese enterprises have made some attempts at independent innovation, but they have not achieved success. The development of high-end chips requires long-term accumulation of technology and talents, and independent innovation in the short term will face huge challenges. Remarkable achievements have been made in Cambrian science and technology and the Qilin in the Sea. They have made great contributions to the development of Chinese chip technology. Thank them!</p>

    <title>Money, mobile phone and computer? Apple&#39;s spring 2022 event is back</title>
    <url>/2022/04/24/%E8%8B%B9%E6%9E%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E4%BC%9A/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Apple held a press conference at the beginning of the month. I watched the press conference with dark circles under my eyes. Today, we don’t talk about products, we don’t talk about software, we will talk about this new product conference.</p>
<p>First up was the new Apple TV Plus. Apple TV Plus is a video subscription service from Apple</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<p><a href="https://muyanglarry.github.io/zh-CN/2022/04/24/%E8%8B%B9%E6%9E%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E4%BC%9A/"><em>点击此处查看<strong>简体中文</strong>页面 (Click here to view the <strong>simplified Chinese</strong> page)</em></a></p>
<p>The advantage of it is that there are no advertisements and you don’t need to have a membership to watch the show, but… It costs a lot to subscribe to. The event was dominated by a lot of talk about the new Apple TV Plus series, etc.</p>
<p>The next entry was, of course, the iPhone. This time, the new green was introduced, and the iPhone 13 Pro also ushered in a new green, showing apple’s modern vitality.</p>
<p>Third came chips that Apple has never been short of, and the iPhone SE. This time, Apple has added the bionic chip of the A15 to the iPhone SE, which is an exact copy of the iPhone 8. The iPhone SE is the 2022 iPhone 8, and the starting price is only 3,999, although that price can buy a high-end Android phone, which is affordable for Apple. But the iPhone SE is 26 times faster than the iPhone 8 and runs iOS 15. It even has the same glass back as the iPhone 13 series. It’s powered by Apple’s advanced Touch ID. There is a very important is that more than three thousand mobile phones have 5G. The iPhone SE is made of eco-friendly materials.</p>
<p>Fourth came the iPad, which is as important as the iPhone. This time, it’s the new iPad Air. The iPad Air 5 is a huge performance boost because it features a new Mac line, the same chip as its older brother, the iPad Pro, the Apple M1, which is 60 percent better than its predecessor. Let’s talk about the lens. This time, the front-facing camera has been upgraded to 12 megapixels, which is the same as the rear of the iPhone 13. The rear of the iPhone 13 was hit by an Air. The iPhone SE has 5G, but how can the iPad Air not have 5G? In addition, the iPad Air 5 also features a smart keyboard, giving it a chance to be productive, at least until it becomes iQiyi again. Such excellent performance, starting at 4,399, is still acceptable. There’s another one, which also runs iPadOS 15. Finally, Apple is as green as ever.</p>
<p>The fifth entry was the Mac, as important as the iPhone and iPad. The first is its chip. Chips in the Mac line include M1, M1 Pro, and M1 Max. This time, Apple announced the M1 Ultra. The announcement says it can bring unmatched performance to computers. Apple has always tried to improve performance by improving architecture, and this time… Apple merged the two M1 Max’s together. This is not a simple fit, even with two CPU connections, it can achieve a staggering 2.5TB&#x2F;s of processing speed and low power consumption. It comes with an equally impressive 128GB of ram and the fastest processing speed on the planet. With chips out of the way, now comes the big story, which is apple’s Mac Studio for The Studio, and the Studio Display. It’s compact, but bigger than two Mac Minis. It is quiet and carries the M1 Ultra. It has a powerful interface and can connect up to four monitors at once. It is powerful enough to play 18 8K ProRes timelines simultaneously. Finally, environmental protection…</p>
